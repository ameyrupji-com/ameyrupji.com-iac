## Infrastructure
The following infrastructure needs to be created to host http://www.ameyrupji.com.

### Initial Setup
This needs to be done manually before you can run the terraform code below:

- Buy/Register ameyrupji.com domain through Route53 Service using the portal.
- Create the following S3 Buckets using the portal
  - ameyrupji.com-iac - Stores the terraform state files.
  - ameyrupji.com-assets - Stores the assets.
- Hosted zones should automatically created while registering domain.
- Create a certificate for *.ameyrupji.com through ACM Servie usijng the portal.

### Created through Terraform 
Two different environments are maintained **prod** and **beta**. For each of these environments the following resources are created:

- S3 Buckets

Bucket Use | Prod Bucket Name | Beta Bucket Name
--- | --- | --- 
Main Subdomain | ameyrupji.com | beta.ameyrupji.com
Alternate Subdomain | www.ameyrupji.com | www.beta.ameyrupji.com
Blog Subdomain | blog.ameyrupji.com | blog.beta.ameyrupji.com
Code Subdomain | code.ameyrupji.com | code.beta.ameyrupji.com
Images Subdomain | images.ameyrupji.com | images.beta.ameyrupji.com

- Hosted Zones Record Sets

Record Set Use | Prod Record Set Name | Beta Record Set Name
--- | --- | --- 
Main Subdomain |  | beta
Alternate Subdomain | www | www.beta
Blog Subdomain | blog | blog.beta
Code Subdomain | code | code.beta
Images Subdomain | images | images.beta

#### TODOs:

- [ ] Api Gateway with domain (api) for sending emails as POST request through the UI.
- [ ] Lambda code as Git Submodule + Build changes.
- [ ] Cloud Front CDN for ameyrupji.com.
- [ ] Upgrade state to store in DynamoDB table to Terraform State.

## Prerequisites
- [x] User for programatic AdminAccess (cli-user)
- [x] S3 Bucket created to store state (ameyrupji.com-iac) and artifacts (ameyrupji.com-artifacts).
- [x] IAM User to run terrafrom scripts (cirlce-ci-iac). The following policies need to be attached:
    - AmazonS3FullAccess
    - AmazonRoute53DomainsFullAccess
    - AWSAPIGatewayAdmin
    - AWSLambdaFullAccess
    - AWSIAMFullAccess
    - AWSCertificateManagerReadOnly
- [x] Update Environment Variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_REGION, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) for CircleCI Build to be able to communicate with AWS.
