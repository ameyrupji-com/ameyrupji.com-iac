This GitHub repository contains the code to create the infrastructure necessary to host my website across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Google). I am using Terraform to create the required infrastructure to enable feature deployment and easy testability of the website.

This code demonstrates my ability to work with multiple cloud providers using terraform to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. I am using CircleCI to build and deploy my infrastructure using enterprise style deployment pattern by using feature branch deployment. 

Please feel free to use any part of this repository. If you find this useful please Star or Folk this repository. If there is any suggestion for improvement within this code feel free to shoot me an email or create an issue.

## Prerequisites

### Installed Software 

- Web browser

### Editors 

- Visual Sudio Code or Atom or any other text exitor of your choice 

### AWS Setup 

This needs to be done manually before you can run the terraform code below:

- Buy/Register ameyrupji.com domain through Route53 Service using the portal.
- Create the following S3 Buckets using the portal
    - ameyrupji.com-iac - Stores the terraform state files.
    - ameyrupji.com-assets, beta.ameyrupji.com-assets - Stores the assets for each environment
- Hosted zones should automatically created while registering domain.
- Create a certificate for *.ameyrupji.com (for prod) and *.beta.ameyrupji.com (for beta) through ACM Servie using the web portal.
- User for programatic AdminAccess (cli-user)
- S3 Bucket created to store state (ameyrupji.com-iac) and artifacts (ameyrupji.com-artifacts).
- IAM User to run terrafrom scripts (cirlce-ci-iac). The following policies need to be attached:
    - AmazonS3FullAccess
    - AmazonRoute53DomainsFullAccess
    - AWSAPIGatewayAdmin
    - AWSLambdaFullAccess
    - AWSIAMFullAccess
    - AWSCertificateManagerReadOnly
- Update Environment Variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_REGION, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) for CircleCI Build to be able to communicate with AWS.

## Infrastructure

The following infrastructure needs to be created to host http://www.ameyrupji.com/

Two different environments are maintained **prod** and **beta**. For each of these environments the following resources are created:

- S3 Buckets

Use | Prod Bucket Name | Beta Bucket Name
--- | --- | --- 
Main Subdomain | ameyrupji.com | beta.ameyrupji.com
Alternate Subdomain | www.ameyrupji.com | www.beta.ameyrupji.com
Blog Subdomain | blog.ameyrupji.com | blog.beta.ameyrupji.com
Code Subdomain | code.ameyrupji.com | code.beta.ameyrupji.com
IaC Subdomain | iac.ameyrupji.com | iac.beta.ameyrupji.com
Images Subdomain | images.ameyrupji.com | images.beta.ameyrupji.com
Old  Subdomain | old.ameyrupji.com | old.beta.ameyrupji.com

- Hosted Zones Record Sets

Use | Prod Record Set Name | Beta Record Set Name
--- | --- | --- 
Main Subdomain |  | beta
Alternate Subdomain | www | www.beta
Blog Subdomain | blog | blog.beta
Code Subdomain | code | code.beta
IaC Subdomain | iac | iac.beta
Images Subdomain | images | images.beta
Old Subdomain | old | old.beta

- API Gateway

Url | Description
--- | --- 
api.ameyrupji.com | API gateway for main domain 
beta.api.ameyrupji.com | API gateway for beta domain

The following endpoints are implemented:

Url | Method | Description
--- | --- | --- 
/ | OPTIONS | Used to enable CORS for _/ (root)_ resource.
/ | GET | Sample Hello world at the root of the website served through the lambda.
/email | OPTIONS | Used to enable CORS for _/email_ resource.
/email | POST | Endpoint to send email to me.
